# [Lesson 1 report](./20231211_lesson_1.md) -> __Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header__

## __Details__

- __Severity:__ *Passive*
- __Family:__ *Web Servers*

## __Risk Information__

- __Risk Factor:__ *Low*

## __Reference Information__

__CWE:__  [200][200]

[200]:    https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html

## __Summary__

The web application server conveys information about the application it is using as a web server through the HTTP "*Server*" response header. Access to such information can help attackers identify other vulnerabilities in your web or application server. By itself, this information, i.e. without the version string, is not very dangerous for the server's security, however, this information in the response header field is almost always useless and is therefore simply an outdated attack vector.

## __Solution__

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "*Server*" header or provide generic details.
