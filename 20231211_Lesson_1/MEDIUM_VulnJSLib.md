# [Lesson 1 report](./20231211_lesson_1.md) -> __Vulnerable JS Library__

## __Details__

- __Severity:__ *Medium*
- __Family:__ *Web Servers*

## __Risk Information__

- __Risk Factor:__ *Medium*

## __Reference Information__

__CWE:__  [829][829]

[829]:    https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html

## __Summary__

When including third-party functionality, such as a web widget, library, or other source of functionality, the product must effectively trust that functionality. Without sufficient protection mechanisms, the functionality could be malicious in nature (*either by coming from an untrusted source, being spoofed, or being modified in transit from a trusted source*). The functionality might also contain its own weaknesses, or grant access to additional functionality and state information that should be kept private to the base system, such as system state information, sensitive application data, or the DOM of a web application.

## __Solution__

Upgrade to the latest version of Bootstrap library.
