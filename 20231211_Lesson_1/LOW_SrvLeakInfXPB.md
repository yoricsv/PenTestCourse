# [Lesson 1 report](./20231211_lesson_1.md) -> __Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header__

## __Details__

- __Severity:__ *Passive*
- __Family:__ *Web Servers*

## __Risk Information__

- __Risk Factor:__ *Low*

## __Reference Information__

__CWE:__  [200][200]

[200]:    https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html

## __Summary__

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header -Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (*early 2014*) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type, rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

This issue still applies to error type pages (*401, 403, 500, etc.*) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.

At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.

## __Solution__

Ensure that the application server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the *X-Content-Type-Options* header to `nosniff` for all web pages.

If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.
