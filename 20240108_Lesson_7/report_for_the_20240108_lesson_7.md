## __DOM XSS__

![DOM XSS](./res/img/TaskDomXss.png)

Solution

1. Run the task.
2. Enter any search query (*e.g.: `img`*)
3. Press the `[Enter]` button.
4. To insert malicious code into the DOM, you need to use an anchor tag (*`#`*) and then add `<img src="bird" onerror=alert(1)>`.

5. Press the `[Enter]` button.

   > __NOTE:__ After executing the search script, the malicious code will be included and stored inside the html page.

6. To check if malicious code has been included in the html code:
   1. Press the `[F12]` button (*to open the developer toolbar*).
   2. Go to the "*Inspector*" tab.
   3. Find the `<p id="srch">` tag.

Solution

1. Run the task.
2. Enter any search query (*for example: `img`*)
3. Click `[Submit Button]`.

   ![Reflected XSS](./res/img/rxss_001.png)

   > __NOTE:__ As we can see, our search query has been inserted into the page.

4. Type `<script>alert(XSS)></script>` and click `[Submit Button]` to insert the malicious code.

   Something is going wrong. Let's see what happened.

5. Press the `[F12]` button (*to open the developer toolbar*).
6. Go to the "*Debugger*" tab.
7. Expand all branches of the "*Sources*" menu.
8. Here we found the file `(index)`.
9. Our code was added, but we missed the open tag `<p>` and "XSS" is not supported here.
10. Let's change our code to `</p><script>alert(1);</script></p>`

11. Click `[Submit Button]`.
12. Malicious code works.

3. Press the `[Submit]` button.

   ![Stored XSS](./res/img/sxss_001.png)

4. Enter any comment (*e.g.: `img`*)
5. Click `[Submit Button]`.

   ![Stored XSS](./res/img/sxss_002.png)

   Our comment has been stored and published.

6. Type `</p><script>alert(1);></script><p>` and click `[Submit Button]` to store the malicious code.

7. Malicious code is executed and stored. Everyone who visits this page will encounter this.
