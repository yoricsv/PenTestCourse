## __1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY__

This document details the security assessment (external penetration testing) of
GPEN.KM. The purpose of the assessment was to provide a review of the security
posture of GPEN.KM Internet infrastructure, as well, as to identify potential weaknesses
in its Internet infrastructure.

### 1. Scope of work

This security assessment covers the remote penetration testing of 2 accessible
servers hosted on 192.168.1.75 and 192.168.1.76 addresses. The assessment was carried
out from a black box perspective, with the only supplied information being the tested
servers IP addresses. No other information was assumed at the start of the assessment.

### 2. Project Objectives

This security assessment is carried out to gauge the security posture of GPEN.KM’s
Internet facing hosts. The result of the assessment is then analyzed for vulnerabilities.
Given the limited time that is given to perform the assessment, only immediately
exploitable services have been tested. The vulnerabilities are assigned a risk rating based
on threat, vulnerability and impact.

### 3. Assumption

While writing the report, we assume that both IP addresses are considered to be
public IP addresses, NDA and rules of engagement has been signed and based on the
information gathering phase the company name is GPEN.KM.

### 4. Timeline

The timeline of the test is as below:

| Penetration Testing   | Start Date/Time   | End Date/Time |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
| Pen Test 1            | mm/dd/yyyy        | mm/dd/yyyy    |

> __Table 1:__ *Penetration Testing Time Line*

### 5. Summary of Findings

| Value     | Number of Risks   |
|:---------:|:-----------------:|
| Low       | 3                 |
| Medium    | 2                 |
