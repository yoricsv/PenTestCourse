## __1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY__

The IT Academy (*hereis "edu"*) provided Selivonchik S. with a special resource for training in conducting penetration testing of web applications in order to identify security weaknesses, capture the flag (*CTF*) and determine the degree of influence on them. As well as developing skills in documenting all research results in an understandable and reproducible form and developing skills in providing recommendations for correcting situations.

![CTF](./res/img/challenges.png)

> __Figure 1__ *Сhallenges*

### 1.1 Scope of work

This security assessment involves remote penetration testing of 1 available server located at 178.172.195.18 and port 11166.

![task](./res/img/task.png)

> __Figure 2__ *Target*

The assessment was conducted from a "black box" perspective, without credentials or any advance knowledge of internally facing environment with the goal of identifying unknown weaknesses, with the only information provided being the IP address and port of the server being tested. No other information was assumed at the start of the assessment.

In-Scope Assets

| Host/URL/IP Address/Port  | Description                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `178.172.195.18:11166`    | IT Academy external resource  |

> __Table 1:__ *Scope details*

### 1.2 Project Objectives

posture, identify vulnerabilities and potential flaws in its design in order to capture as many flags (*CTF*) as possible. Testing was conducted remotely via a host dedicated to this evaluation. Each identified vulnerability is assigned a threat-based risk rating and manually reviewed to determine its potential for exploitation and escalation.

### 1.3 Assumption

When writing the report, we assume that a special resource will be in the public domain for a short period of time and signing a non-disclosure agreement (*NDA*) and rules of interaction with it does not make sense.

### 1.4 Timeline

The timeline of the test is as below:

| Penetration Testing   | Start Date/Time   | End Date/Time |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
| Pen Test 1            | 12/11/2023        | 12/20/2023    |

> __Table 2:__ *Penetration Testing Time Line*

### 1.5 Summary of Findings

This table shows the number of alerts for each __risk__ and __confidence level__ included in the report.

| Confidence:           | High  | Medium    | Low   | TOTAL |
|----------------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|------:|
| Risk Level __High__   | 0     | 0         | 0     | 0     |
| Risk Level __Medium__ | 1     | 2         | 0     | 3     |

> __Table 4:__ *Risk Analysis*

### 1.6 Summary of Recommendation

1. Ensure that the web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the *Content-Security-Policy* header. Set a __non-permissive__ *Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors* header for all requested resources.
2. Modern web browsers support the *Content-Security-Policy* and `X-Frame-Options` HTTP headers. Make sure one of these is set on all web pages returned by the site or application. If the page is to be generated only by pages on the server (*eg it is part of a `FRAMESET`*) then `SAMEORIGIN` should be used, otherwise if the page will never be generated in a frame then `DENY` should be used. As an alternative, consider implementing the Content Security Policy's "*frame-ancestors*" directive.
3. Upgrade to the latest version of Bootstrap library.
4. Ensure that the application server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the *X-Content-Type-Options* header to `nosniff` for all web pages.

   If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

5. Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "*Server*" header or provide generic details.
6. It is necessary to develop special handler rules for the user agent (*firewall, application, etc.*). Depends on implementation.

### 2.1 Information Gathering

To find existing (*and/or hidden*) web objects, I used the DIRB web content scanner (*comes with Kali*).

```sh
dirb http://178.172.195.18:11166/ /home/vagrant/Downloads/fuzz.txt
```

### 2.2 Planning

Now we need to explore the resources found.

- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/index.php`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/credentials.txt`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/config.php`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/php.ini`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/robots.txt`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/admin/index.php`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/js/main`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/css/custom`
- `http://178.172.195.18:11166/phpmyadmin/index.php`

There are various tools for this. The choice of tool set depends on your goals. For web exploitation purposes I plan to use:

- Browser Developer Tools
- Perform a detour
- Basic SQL injection
- Swigger Port Resources

### 2.3 Exploitation

There are a few common places I can go to determine the current architecture:

- HTTP headers
- Cookie
- HTML, CSS and JS source code
- Specific files and folders.
- File extensions
- Error message

I can do all the research using standard browser development tools.

> __NOTE:__
>
> I think I may have to use __dirb__ or __dirbuster__ to search deeper for information about *Specific files and folders* and *File extensions*, but I've already done that in the [information gathering](#21 information-gathering) phase.

### 2.4 Reporting

I was able to find most of the flags using standard *browser development tools*.

#### *1.1 - Recon Flag1*

To find the first flag you need to do the following:

1. Open a browser and go to `http://178.172.195.18:11166/robots.txt`
2. The flag is here
